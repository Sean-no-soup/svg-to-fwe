 ## Features
 - LINE-INATOR!!! convert curves to lines (fwe only uses lines)
 - preview in browser vectors (very incomplete)

## planned features/functions/to-do
 - implement svgpathtools in export to fwe  EXPORT-INATOR
 - fix color
 - implement transforms from svg
 - if __name__ == "__main__": so functions could be used as a library (but with svgpathtools is that needed?, perhaps to implement a gui)

Release!

 - fix and add option to set terrain flags
 - normalize scale of new blocks
 - preview
 - default option to limit node count on small radii
 - option to use color to set team of terrain blocks
 - gradient approximations
 - option to attempt removal of degenerate block areas (0-width, spindly artifacts of trace. ect)
 - subtractions?
 - incorporate destructible terrain script
